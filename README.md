# Sheaf UI Components

A collection of open source UI components built with Blade, Alpine.js, and Livewire for Laravel applications.

## Philosophy

We believe developers shouldn't waste time copy-pasting code from documentation or hunting through GitHub repositories for UI components. Sheaf UI streamlines your workflow by delivering production-ready components directly into your codebase with simple CLI commands.

Our philosophy centers on:
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Skip the copy-paste workflow entirely
- **Component Ownership**: Once installed, components are fully yours to customize
- **Laravel-First**: Built specifically for Laravel developers using familiar technologies
- **Open Source**: Community-driven development with transparent, accessible code

## Purpose

Sheaf UI exists to solve the common pain points Laravel developers face when building user interfaces:

- **Eliminate Copy-Paste Friction**: No more switching between documentation and your IDE
- **Accelerate Development**: Get from idea to implementation faster
- **Maintain Consistency**: Use battle-tested, production-ready components
- **Preserve Flexibility**: Components integrate seamlessly with your existing workflow

## Technology Stack

All components are built using:
- **Blade**: Laravel's templating engine for clean, maintainable markup
- **Alpine.js**: Lightweight JavaScript framework for reactive behavior
- **Livewire**: Full-stack framework for dynamic Laravel applications
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling

Components support both Alpine.js and Livewire, allowing you to use one or both technologies based on your project needs.
