## Documentation 

### Overview 
Hey There! ðŸ‘‹

Let me walk you through the SimpleSearch component a simple yet powerful search feature thatâ€™s built with Livewire. Itâ€™s designed to make your life easier by offering real-time search with highlighted results. If you're looking to build something similar, don't worry! Iâ€™ve got your back. Let's dive in step by step.

### Setting Things Up
First, we need to create a Livewire component. Donâ€™t panic itâ€™s just one simple Artisan command. Open up your terminal and run this:

```shell
php artisan livewire:make Search/Index
```
This command will generate two things for you:

**A backend class**: ``App/Livewire/Search/Index``.
**A Blade view**: the front-facing part of your search.

For now, weâ€™ll focus on the backend logic to make the search work.

###  The Backend Search Logic
```php
<?php

namespace Livewire\Search;

use App\Models;
use Livewire\Component;
use Livewire\Attributes\Layout;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;
use App\Support\Highlighter;

class Index extends Component
{
    const CLASSES = 'text-violet-500 font-semibold';
    
    public string $search = "";

    public function getResults()
    {
        ....
    }

    public function getUrl($slug)
    {
        ....
    }

    public function baseQuery()
    {
        ....
    }

    public function render()
    {
        return view('livewire.search.index', [
            'results' => $this->getResults(),
        ]);
    }
}

```

we added a ``$search`` property to bind it with the input in the `UI` it consider as the search query.

the ``baseQuery`` function is a just an example of the desired model's table to be searched in this case we use the components table as a use case but be sure to configure it to fit your need.

so whenever the search content change (as the user type in real time) the ``getResults`` will run and send the search results to the *UI* via the `results` variable, so let's explore the ``getResults`` function in the following section:

```php
    public function getResults()
    {
        $search = trim($this->search);

        if (empty($search)) {
            return  new Collection();
        }


        $results = $this
            ->baseQuery()
            ->select('id', 'name','slug')
            ->where('name', 'like', '%' . $this->search . '%')
            ->get()
            ->map(function ($component) use ($search) {
                $result = new \stdClass();
                $result->title = Highlighter::make(
                    text: $component->name,
                    pattern: $search,
                    classes: self::CLASSES
                );
                $result->url = $this->getUrl($component->slug);
                return $result;
            });

        return $results;
    }
```
first we need to trim the search term to prevent uncessary queries like when the search term is space ... so we use the ``trim`` function for that, then we check if search is empty 

```php
    if (empty($search)) {
        return  new Collection();
    }
``` 
to return an empty collection and stop going further. if the search is not empty we need to complete our way to querying the database.

The ``$classes`` A CSS class is defined for highlighting matched search patterns

```php
$results = $this
    ->baseQuery()
    ->select(['id', 'name', 'slug'])
    ->where('name', 'like', "%{$this->search}%")
    ->get()
    ->map(fn($component) => (object) [
        'title' => Highlighter::make(
            text: $component->name,
            pattern: $search,
            classes: self::CLASSES
        ),
        'url' => $this->getUrl($component->slug),
    ]);
```

The query selects the ``id``, ``name``, and ``slug`` columns and filters them based on the search term. Each result is highlighted and mapped into an object with a title and URL.


```php
public function getUrl($slug)
{
    return route('components.show', $slug);
}
```
The getUrl function generates a link for each search result.

As I said eirlier this is just an example query.

now let's deep dive into the highliter class wich's the core of highliting queries 

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Support;

final class Highlighter
{
    public static function make(?string $text, ?string $pattern, ?string $styles = '', ?string $classes = '')
    {

        if (blank($pattern)) {
            return $text;
        }

        $highlightedPattern = '<span';

        if (! empty($classes)) {

            $highlightedPattern .= ' class="'.$classes.'"';
        }

        if (! empty($styles)) {

            $highlightedPattern .= ' style="'.$styles.'"';
        }

        $highlightedPattern .= '>$0</span>';

        return preg_replace('/('.preg_quote($pattern, '/').')/i', $highlightedPattern, $text);
    }
}
```
the class has ```make()``` static method that accept subject ``$text`` the ``$pattern`` wich is the query term it also accet two optional (but important ) ``styles`` and ``classes`` parameters 

First, the method checks if the pattern is empty and returns the original text early if so. Then it constructs the highlighted HTML using a ```html <span class="..." style="...">$0</span>``` structure, where ``$0`` is a regex placeholder for matched text.

Finally, ``preg_replace()`` searches the subject for occurrences of the query term and replaces them with the constructed highlighted pattern.

The ``preg_quote()`` function is used to escape special characters in the pattern to ensure safe regex execution.

This regex-based highlighting approach provides flexibility and simplicity compared to algorithmic alternatives.

now we ensure that the returen query is highlited withing a span let's focus now on the fron-end

### The Front-End Logic
while the design is build in different mind that the mind that read this docs, it ensure to build something beautiful, fully accessible, easy to customize.. so let's start the front end journey 

First we have the entry point. The ``index.blade.php`` livewire component 

```html
<x-modal
    openEvent="open-global-search"
    closeEvent="close-global-search"
>
    <x-slot:trigger>
        .... act as the trigger of the modal
    </x-slot:trigger>
    <x-slot:header class="border-b border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-800 px-2">
        .... act as search input
    </x-slot:header>
        .... act as results wrapper
    <x-slot:footer>
        <x-search.footer/>        
    </x-slot:footer>
</x-modal>
```
#### the modal trigger 
I styled a nice button look as a button to open our search modal 

```html
<x-slot:trigger>
    <div 
        class="flex items-center w-60  justify-center" 
    >
        <div class="pointer-events-auto  relative bg-white dark:bg-black rounded-lg">
            <button
                class="hidden w-full items-center rounded-lg py-1.5 pl-2 pr-3 text-sm leading-6 text-slate-400 shadow-sm ring-2  ring-purple-500/15 hover:ring-purple-500 transition-all duration-300 dark:hover:bg-[#02031C] lg:flex"
                type="button"
            >
            <x-icon.search 
                size="5"
                class="mr-3"
                stroke="3"
            />Quick search...
            </button>
        </div>
    </div>
</x-slot:trigger>
``` 
make sure to copy the icons from the files tabs.

Alright, since now we have the trigger setup correctly let's build the search itself.
