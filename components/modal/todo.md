## üö® Here's the brutally honest checklist you're missing (or need to double-check):

### 1. **Focus Management (Accessibility)**

* [ ] Auto-focus on first focusable element inside modal
* [ ] Focus trap inside modal (no tabbing out accidentally)
* [ ] Restore focus to the previously focused element when closed

**Challenge**: Try navigating the modal with only `Tab` and `Esc`. If it breaks, it's not ready.

---

### 2. **Scroll Handling**

* [x] Body scroll lock (for nested modals too)
* [x] Handle iOS-specific quirks with `-webkit-overflow-scrolling`
* [x] When modal opens, prevent layout shift (scrollbar compensation)

---

### 3. **Nested Modals**

* [ ] Open modal on top of another modal without breaking scroll/focus
* [ ] Maintain independent state for each instance
* [ ] Stacking z-index logic (no z-index hell)

**Bonus**: Allow ‚Äúattached modals‚Äù that don‚Äôt cover the full screen, like dropdown-modal hybrids.

### 4. **Transition System**

* [ ] Separate transitions for backdrop and content
* [ ] Animate in and out smoothly with cancelable hooks (`onOpen`, `onClose`)
* [ ] Prevent DOM teardown until animation completes

---

### 5. **Multiple Triggers**

* [ ] Allow declarative trigger (`x-on:click`) AND programmatic open/close
* [ ] Support links, buttons, and hotkeys to open modals

---

### 6. **Keyboard Controls**

* [ ] `Escape` to close
* [ ] `Enter` to confirm (when relevant)
* [ ] `Arrow keys` to navigate inner content (if modal has steps/tabs)

---

### 7. **Persistent State (Optional)**

* [ ] Store modal open/close state in:

  * `localStorage`
  * or `query string` (`?modal=contact`)
* [ ] Restore state on reload if persisted

### 8. **Modals in Modals / Forms in Modals**

* [ ] Works inside Livewire forms
* [ ] No DOM teardown issues with Livewire re-renders
* [ ] Handles validation errors and auto-scrolls to invalid input

---

### 9. **Customizable via Props**

* [ ] Size (sm, md, lg, xl, full)
* [ ] Alignment (top, center, bottom)
* [ ] Backdrop (solid, transparent, none)
* [ ] Close button optional or slot
* [ ] ARIA labels auto-set from title or custom prop

### 10. **Blade API That Scales**

Your blade API should look like this:

```blade
<x-ui.modal name="delete-user" size="lg" :persistent="true" :keyboard="false">
    <x-slot name="title">Delete Account</x-slot>
    <x-slot name="footer">
        <x-ui.button>Cancel</x-ui.button>
        <x-ui.button type="danger">Delete</x-ui.button>
    </x-slot>
    <p>Are you sure you want to delete?</p>
</x-ui.modal>
```
